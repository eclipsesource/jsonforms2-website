We released v3.2.0 ðŸŽ‰. Besides various fixes and improved developer tooling, this release adds middleware support to all bindings. This makes it a breeze to hook into data updates!

With this release, the Angular bindings and Angular Material renderer set now support Angular 16 and 17. Special thanks to [JBBianchi](https://github.com/JBBianchi) for contributing this massive upgrade.

You can find the full changelog in the [Github release](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/releases/tag/v3.2.0).

We welcome any feedback of curious users. Any questions? Check out our [community forum](http://jsonforms.discourse.group).
