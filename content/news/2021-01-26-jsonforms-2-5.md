Today we released JSON Forms v2.5 üéâ This release marks the final step in our quest to remove Redux as a hard dependency of JSON Forms. Check our updated migration guide if you'd like to migrate to the Redux-less variants.
We also like to announce the new JSON Forms Vue 2 & Vue 3 support. Many thanks to headwire.com whose sponsoring made the JSON Forms Vue bindings possible. Among others they plan to power peregrine-cms.com with JSON Forms Vue and decided to contribute back ‚ù§Ô∏è.
We now also work on a basic JSON Forms Vue renderer set which we plan to release with one of the next versions of JSON Forms! See you soon!
