It's a new renderer set! Last week we published JSON Forms v2.5.1 containing our new Vue 3 and Vue 2 vanilla renderer sets. Big thanks to [headwire.com](https://www.headwire.com/) who partly sponsored the new renderers!

We also have two new renderers for React Material: boolean toggles and multiple choice (array of enum values).

Other changes include fixes for the Angular renderers as well as improvements to the core framework. Check out the [detailed change list](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/releases/tag/v2.5.1).
