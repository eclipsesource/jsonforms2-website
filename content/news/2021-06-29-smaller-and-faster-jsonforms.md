We're working on our next major release. Our main focus is on improving the core module and overhauling our build including our published bundles. In the end we'll have a smaller and faster JSON Forms for all bindings and renderer sets.
The refactoring of JSON Forms' core dependencies is already available on the npm `next` stream via our latest prerelease `3.0.0-alpha.0`. Additionally JSON Forms is now also compatible with Angular 12 by default. Interested? Try it today, we're always looking for feedback ðŸ˜€
