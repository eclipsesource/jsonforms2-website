We just released a new JSON Forms preview "2.5.1-alpha.1" on the "next" stream. Most importantly we added a basic renderer set for our Vue 3 and Vue 2 bindings. Check our new [JSON Forms Vue seed](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-vue-seed) to try it out yourself!

The new Vue renderer set is in a preview state and feedback is welcome! Let us know what you think in our [community forum](https://jsonforms.discourse.group/).

Also included in the prerelease are a new toggle boolean control and a multi-select checkbox enum renderer for the React Material renderer set.
