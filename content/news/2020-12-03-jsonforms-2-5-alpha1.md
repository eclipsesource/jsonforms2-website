We released the first alpha version of JSON Forms 2.5.0 🍾. It not only includes various performance improvements for React but is also the first version completely free of Redux.
We also enhanced our Angular bindings with the ability to render multiple forms at the same time as well as adding explicit 'readonly' and 'validationMode' support which already existed in the React renderers.
Check our migration guide if you still use the Redux variant of JSON Forms. We also included a convenient fallback if you're not ready for the full migration yet. Angular users should also take a look 🔎.
