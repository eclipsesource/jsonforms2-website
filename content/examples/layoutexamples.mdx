import {
   Group,
   HorizontalLayout,
   NestedLayouts,
   VerticalLayout
} from '../../src/components/examples/Layouts';

All layout examples use the same schema which is an `object` with
two `properties`, `name` and `birthDate`.

## Horizontal layout

<HorizontalLayout />

## Vertical layout

<VerticalLayout />

## Group

A `Group` is like a `VerticalLayout` but features an additional `label` property.
In this case it has been set to 'My Group'.

<Group />

## Nested layouts

This example demonstrates how layouts can be nested in order to create more complex forms.
The top UI schema element is a `Group` which in turn contains a `HorizontalLayout`.
The `elements` of the `HorizontalLayout` then are again `VerticalLayout`.

<NestedLayouts />
