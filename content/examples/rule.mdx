import Rule from '../../src/components/examples/Rule';

This example uses two [rules](/docs/uischema/rules).
The first rule manages the enablement of a control based on whether the 'Is Dead' checkbox is checked.
The second rule manages the visibility of a control based on whether the "Eats vegetables?" checkbox is checked.
Give it a try!
