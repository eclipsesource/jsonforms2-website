This example demonstrates that the default renderers of JSON Forms can be replaced with custom ones.
We've replaced the default renderer for integers (which have a maximum value of 5 here) with one
displaying stars (at the bottom of the form).

You can read more about custom controls in the [Custom renderers section](/docs/tutorial/custom-renderers).
