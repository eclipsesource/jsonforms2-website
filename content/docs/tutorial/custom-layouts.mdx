import { Default, WithCustomRenderer } from '../../../src/components/docs/tutorials/custom-layouts';

The default layouts of JSON Forms are a good fit for most scenarios, but there might be certain situations where you'd want to customize the rendered layouts.
JSON Forms allows for this by registering a custom renderer that produces a different UI for a given layout.

In this section you will learn how to create and register a custom renderer for a layout.

:::info Note

While the high level concepts are the same, there are large implementation differences between the offered React, Angular and Vue renderer sets.
This tutorial describes how to add custom renderers for React-based renderer sets.

:::

We will replace the default renderer for groups. By default a group is rendered like this:

<Default />

Our goal is to instead render the UI for groups as depicted below:

<WithCustomRenderer />

## Running the seed

If you want to follow along with this tutorial, you may want to [clone the seed repository](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed) which basically is just a skeleton application scaffolded by create-react-app with the JSON Forms dependencies added.

```bash
cd jsonforms-react-seed
npm install
npm start
```

Once the dependencies are installed and the local server has been started, navigate to http://localhost:3000 in order to see the application running.

The seed is described in more detail within the `README.md` file of the [repo](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed), hence we only focus on the most crucial parts of the app in the following.

## Core concepts about rendering

Before explaining how to contribute a component (which will be referred to as "custom layout") to JSON Forms, we first explain how the basic process of rendering works.

JSON Forms maintains a registry of renderers (which are regular React components in case of the React/Material renderers we use in this tutorial).
When JSON Forms is instructed to render a given UI schema to produce a form, it will start with the root element of the UI Schema and try to find a renderer for this UI Schema element in its registry of renderers.

To find a matching renderer, JSON Forms relies on so-called testers.
Every renderer has a tester associated with its registration, which is a function of a UI schema and a JSON schema returning a number.
The returned number is the priority which expresses if and how well a renderer can actually render the given UI Schema Element (where `NOT_APPLICABLE` aka. `-1` means "not at all").

In order to create and register a renderer, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Change UI Schema to contain a group
2. Create a renderer (a React component)
3. Create a corresponding tester for the renderer
4. Register both the renderer and the tester with the framework

The seed app already contains all of the ingredients necessary to create a custom layout, which we'll use in the following.

### 1. Add Group to UI Schema

The first step is to extend our UI Schema and add a Group to it.
You can find the UISchema in `src\uischema.json`.
We can change the type of the root from `"type": "VerticalLayout",` to `"type": "Group",`.
As a group can have a label we should add it, too: `"label": "My Group!",` .
We can keep everything else unchanged.

### 2. Create a renderer

We first need to create a new `src\MyGroup.jsx` file.

Here we can code our component. For our example we create a single Accordion.
In order to render the child elements we reuse the `MaterialLayoutRenderer` which we can import from `@jsonforms/material-renderers`.

In order to use our React component as a JSON Forms compatible renderer, we can make use of the `withJsonFormsLayoutProps` utility function from JSON Forms that will give us all relevant props to render the group and delegate to the layout renderer.
In this case, the props are:
`uischema`, which is the actual uischema element to be rendered
`path`, which is necessary to scope the element
`schema`, which is the JSON Schema
`visible`, which tells us whether the renderer is visible based on rule evaluation
`renderers`, which is the list of all known renderers and will be needed for further rendering

The complete code of `src/MyGroup.jsx` looks as follows:

```jsx
import { MaterialLayoutRenderer } from '@jsonforms/material-renderers';
import {
  Accordion,
  AccordionDetails,
  AccordionSummary,
  Hidden,
  Typography,
} from '@mui/material';
import ExpandMoreIcon from '@mui/icons-material/ExpandMore';
import React from 'react';
import { withJsonFormsLayoutProps } from '@jsonforms/react';

const MyGroupRenderer = (props) => {
  const { uischema, schema, path, visible, renderers } = props;

  const layoutProps = {
    elements: uischema.elements,
    schema: schema,
    path: path,
    direction: 'column',
    visible: visible,
    uischema: uischema,
    renderers: renderers,
  };
  return (
    <Hidden xsUp={!visible}>
      <Accordion>
        <AccordionSummary expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}>
          <Typography>{uischema.label}</Typography>
        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
          <MaterialLayoutRenderer {...layoutProps} />
        </AccordionDetails>
      </Accordion>
    </Hidden>
  );
};

export default withJsonFormsLayoutProps(MyGroupRenderer);
```

### 3. Create a tester

Now that we have our renderer ready, we need to tell JSON Forms when we want to make use of it.
For that purpose we create a tester that checks if the corresponding UI schema element is a group.
If that is the case, we return a rank of `1000`.

Add the following code to `src/MyGroup.jsx`:

```js
import { rankWith, uiTypeIs } from '@jsonforms/core';

export const myGroupTester = rankWith(1000, uiTypeIs('Group'));
```

Generally speaking, the testers API is made out of different predicates and functions that allow for composition (e.g. `and` or `or`) such that it is easy to target specific parts of the UI schema and/or JSON schema.

### 4. Register the renderer

All that's left to do is to use the renderer with its tester. We can do so by appending the renderer/tester pair to the array of renderer registrations used by the `JsonForms` component.
Within `App.tsx`, find the list of renderers used by the standalone `JsonForms` component and add the renderer and its tester like so:

```js
import MyGroupRenderer, { myGroupTester } from './MyGroup';

// list of renderers declared outside the App component
const renderers = [
  ...materialRenderers,
  //register custom renderers
  { tester: myGroupTester, renderer: MyGroupRenderer },
];
```

Then, by simply passing the list of renderers to JSON Forms, our custom layout renderer will be picked up for the Group ui element.

```js
<JsonForms
  // other necessary declarations go here...
  renderers={renderers}
/>
```

And that's it! The MyGroup renderer will now be used to render the `Group` element.

## Dispatching

When writing custom renderers that themselves dispatch to JSON Forms, there are two components that can be used: `ResolvedJsonFormsDispatch` and `JsonFormsDispatch`.
For performance reasons, it is almost always preferable to use the `ResolvedJsonFormsDispatch` component.
In contrast to `ResolvedJsonFormsDispatch`, the `JsonFormsDispatch` component will additionally check and resolve external schema refs, which is almost never needed in a nested component such as a renderer.

Simple example renderer using dispatching:

```js
const MyLayoutRenderer = ({
  schema,
  uischema,
  path,
  renderers,
  cells,
  enabled,
  visible,
}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      {visible &&
        uischema.elements.map((child, index) => (
          <ResolvedJsonFormsDispatch
            schema={schema}
            uischema={child}
            path={path}
            enabled={enabled}
            renderers={renderers}
            cells={cells}
            key={index}
          />
        ))}
    </div>
  );
};
export default withJsonFormsLayoutProps(MyLayoutRenderer);
```
