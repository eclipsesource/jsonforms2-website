import { PersonVars } from '../../../src/components/docs/tutorials/create-app';

This section describes how you can integrate JSON Forms into a React app from scratch.
Alternatively you can also clone the [seed app](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed).

1. We'll use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to scaffold a basic React application which we'll use as a starting point.
  If you didn't install `create-react-app` yet, please do so now before continuing.

  Let's now create a basic application with:

  ```bash
  npx create-react-app my-jsonforms-app
  ```

  If you want to use typescript within your project, use the following command instead:

  ```bash
  npx create-react-app my-jsonforms-app --template typescript
  ```

  Scaffolding may take a couple of moments.
  Once it's finished, switch to your newly created app.

  ```bash
  cd my-jsonforms-app
  ```

2. Install JSON Forms and the material renderer set.
  We'll use an example from JSON Forms in order to obtain a JSON schema, a corresponding UI schema and a data instance to be rendered.
  You don't need to install the `@jsonforms/examples` package if you plan to supply your own schema in the following:

  ```bash
  npm install --save @jsonforms/core
  npm install --save @jsonforms/react
  npm install --save @jsonforms/material-renderers
  npm install --save @jsonforms/examples

  npm install --save @mui/material
  npm install --save @mui/icons-material
  npm install --save @mui/x-date-pickers

  npm install --save @emotion/styled
  npm install --save @emotion/react 
  ```

3. Switch to the `src` directory and open `App.js` (`App.tsx` when using typescript) with an editor of your choice.
  Let's add a couple of imports first:

  ```js
  import { person } from '@jsonforms/examples';
  import {
    materialRenderers,
    materialCells,
  } from '@jsonforms/material-renderers';
  ```

  The `person` import is necessary for importing the person example while `@jsonforms/material-renderers` imports the [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) based renderer set and respective cells.

  Now let's define the variables that are crucial for JSON Forms to work, that is, `data`, `schema` and `uischema`.
  As previously mentioned, we are using the person example from JSON Forms here:

  ```js
  const schema = person.schema;
  const uischema = person.uischema;
  const initialData = person.data;
  ```

  These variables are defined as follows:

  <PersonVars />

4. Now import the `JsonForms` component from `@jsonforms/react`.
  Delete the `header` element and replace it with the `JsonForms` element to get a form rendered:

  ```jsx
  import React, { useState } from 'react';
  import { JsonForms } from '@jsonforms/react';

  function App() {
    const [data, setData] = useState(initialData);
    return (
      <div className='App'>
        <JsonForms
          schema={schema}
          uischema={uischema}
          data={data}
          renderers={materialRenderers}
          cells={materialCells}
          onChange={({ data, errors }) => setData(data)}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  The optional `onChange` handler demonstrates how you can listen to data and validation changes in JSON Forms.

5. Now you have a basic form up and running!
  Take a look at our [seed app](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed) for more examples.
