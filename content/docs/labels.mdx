import { PropertyLabel, SchemaLabel, UiSchemaLabel } from '../../src/components/docs/labels'

There are three different ways, how a label is determined by JSON Forms:
- If there is no JSON Schema `title` and no UI schema `label`, it is derived from property name
- If there is no UI schema `label` but a JSON Schema `title`, it will be taken
- If there is a UI schema `label`, it will be used

## Derived by property

When no `title` in the UI schema and no `label` in the JSON schema is provided, JSON Forms will derive the name directly from the property name.
For example if the input name is `firstname`, the label will be `Firstname`.
In order to have a label with multiple separated words, camel case can be used.
If the input name is `firstName`, the label will be `First Name`.

:::note
The first letter must always be lowercase!

## UI Schema `label`

If you want to set a label explicitly, the recommend way is to use the `label` attribute within the UI schema.

```js
{
  properties: {
    name: {
      type: "string",
      title: "First Name"
    }
  }
}
```

<UiSchemaLabel />

## JSON Schema `title`

Another option is to use the `title` attribute within the JSON schema.

```js
{
  type: "VerticalLayout",
  elements: [
    {
      type: "Control",
      scope: "#/properties/name",
      label: "First Name"
    }
  ]
}
```

<SchemaLabel />
