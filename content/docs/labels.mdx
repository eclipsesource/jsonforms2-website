import { OneOfLabel, PropertyLabel, SchemaLabel, UiSchemaLabel } from '../../src/components/docs/labels'

There are three different ways, how a label is determined by JSON Forms in the following order:
- If an UI Schema `label` is set, it will be used as the label
- If there is no UI Schema `label` **but** a JSON Schema `title`, the JSON Schema `title` will be used as the label
- If there is no UI schema `label` **and** no JSON Schema `title`, the label will be derived derived from the property name

## Derived by property

When no `label` in the UI Schema and no `title` in the JSON Schema is provided, JSON Forms will derive the label directly from the property name.
For example if the input name is `firstname`, the label will be `Firstname`.
In order to have a label with multiple separated words, camel case can be used.
So if the input name is `firstName`, the label will be `First Name`.

## JSON Schema `title`

If you want to set a label explicitly, one way is to use the `title` attribute within JSON schema.

```js
{
  properties: {
    name: {
      type: "string",
      title: "First Name"
    }
  }
}
```

<SchemaLabel />

## UI Schema `label`

Alternatively you can also set a label by using the `label` attribute within the UI schema.

```js
{
  type: "VerticalLayout",
  elements: [
    {
      type: "Control",
      scope: "#/properties/name",
      label: "First Name"
    }
  ]
}
```

<UiSchemaLabel />

## `oneOf` enum titles

Since JSON Schema does not provide any way to set custom labels for enums, you can use an `oneOf` enum construct in order to give your enums specific labels:

```js
{
  properties: {
    gender: {
      oneOf: [
        {
          const: "male",
          title: "Male"
        },
        {
          const: "female",
          title: "Female"
        },
        {
          const: "other",
          title: "Diverse"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<OneOfLabel />
