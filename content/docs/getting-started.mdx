The easiest way to start is to use our React + Material UI seed app.

1. Clone the [seed](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed) app with `git clone`
2. Install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```
3. Run the app in development mode with:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

For more information about the seed app, please see the corresponding README file of the [seed repo](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed).

For a more detailed guide about the usage of JSON Forms, please see [our tutorial](tutorial).

## Other starters

We also maintain an [Angular seed](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-angular-seed) and a [Vue seed](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-vue-seed).
