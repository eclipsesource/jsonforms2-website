Currently this integration is in a preview state!

:::

With version 2.5 of JSON Forms we added support for Vue 2 (`@jsonforms/vue2`) and Vue 3 (`@jsonforms/vue`).
Support for Vue 2 was dropped with JSON Forms 3.2.
The last official release containg Vue 2 is [v3.1.0](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/tree/v3.1.0).

For Vue we provide a HTML5 based renderer set, `@jsonforms/vue-vanilla` for Vue 3.
Additionally we offer a [jsonforms-vue-seed](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-vue-seed), which allows to get a quick start with our Vue integration.

For further information on how to use JSON Forms Vue and how to write an own renderer set, please consult the README.md files for the [Vue](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/vue/README.md) bindings as well as the [Vue vanilla](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/vue-vanilla/README.md) and the [Vue Vuetify](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-vuetify-renderers/blob/vue3/vue-vuetify/README.md) renderer sets.
