Rules allow for dynamic aspects for a form, e.g. by hiding or disabling UI schema elements.

A rule may be attached to any UI schema element and can be defined with the `rule` property which looks like:

```js
"rule": {
  "effect": "HIDE" | "SHOW" | "ENABLE" | "DISABLE",
  "condition": {
    "scope": "<UI Schema scope>",
    "schema": JSON Schema
  }
}
```

A rule basically works by first evaluating the `condition` property and in case it evaluates to true, executing the associated `effect`.


## Rule Effect

The `effect` property determines what should happen to the attached UI schema element once the `condition` is met.
Current effects include:

- `HIDE`: hide the UI schema element
- `SHOW`: show the UI schema element
- `DISABLE`: disable the UI schema element
- `ENABLE`: enable the UI schema element

## Rule Condition

The rule `condition` object contains a `scope` and a `schema` property.
The `schema` property is a standard JSON schema object.
This means, everything that can be specified using JSON schema can be used in the rule condition.
The `schema` is validated against the data specified in the `scope` property.
If the `scope` data matches the `schema` the rule evaluates to true and the rule effect is applied.

Note, `SchemaBasedCondition`s have been introduced with version 2.0.6 and have become the new default.
The previous format via `type` and `expectedValue` properties is still supported for the time being.

## Examples

Below are some common rule examples.

To match a scope variable to a specific value, "const" can be used:

```js
"rule": {
  "effect": "HIDE",
  "condition": {
    "scope": "#/properties/counter",
    "schema": { const: 10 }
  }
}
```
Here, the control is hidden when the `counter` property is equal to `10`.

Similar, to match multiple values, `enum` can be used:

```js
"rule": {
  "effect": "HIDE",
  "condition": {
    "scope": "#/properties/name",
    "schema": { enum: ["foo", "bar"] }
  }
}
```
The rule evaluates to true if the `scope` property `name` is either "foo" or "bar".

A rule can be negated using "not":

```js
"rule": {
  "effect": "SHOW",
  "condition": {
    "scope": "#/properties/counter",
    "schema": { not: { const: 10 } }
  }
}
```

The following rule evaluates to true if the `counter` property is `1 <= counter < 10`:

```js
"rule": {
  "effect": "SHOW",
  "condition": {
    "scope": "#/properties/counter",
    "schema": {  minimum: 1, exclusiveMaximum: 10 }
  }
}
```


A rule can even operate on the full form data object and over multiple properties:

```js
"rule": {
  "effect": "SHOW",
  "condition": {
    "scope": "#",
    "schema": {
      "properties": {
        "stringArray": { "contains": { "const": "Foo"  }  }
      },
      "required": ["stringArray", "otherProperty"]
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, the condition is true if the properties "stringArray" and "otherProperty" are set in the form data and the "stringArray" property contains an element "Foo".
Note, that the schema rule in this example looks more like a normal JSON schema as it is commonly used.
