Rules allow for dynamic aspects for a form, e.g. by hiding or disabling UI schema elements.

A rule may be attached to any UI schema element and can be defined with the `rule` property.
We'll first look at an example definition of a rule and then explain it in detail.

```javascript
"rule": {
  "effect": "HIDE",
  "condition": {
    "scope": "#/properties/name",
    "schema": { enum: ["foo"] }
  }
}
```

A rule basically works by first evaluating the `condition` property and in case it evaluates
to true, executing the associated `effect`.

## RuleEffect

The `effect` property determines what should happen to the attached
UI schema element once the `condition` is met. In the example
above, if the `name` property has the value of `foo`,
we'll hide the UI schema element the rule is attached to. Current effects
include:

- `HIDE`: hide the UI schema element
- `SHOW`: show the UI schema element
- `DISABLE`: disable the UI schema element
- `ENABLE`: enable the UI schema element

The `condition` property describes what value should be observed and validates that value with
against the JSON schema that is specified with `schema`. If validation succeeds the condition is fulfilled
and the associated `effect` will be triggered.

`SchemaBasedCondition`s have been introduced with version 2.0.6 and
have become the new default. The previous format via `type` and
`expectedValue` properties is still supported for the time being.
