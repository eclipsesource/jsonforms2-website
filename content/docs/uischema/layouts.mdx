Layout elements in the UI Schema contain other UI Schema elements like controls or other layouts and serve the purpose of defining the layout of those, e.g. a layout could arrange all its contained UI Schema Elements into a horizontal alignment.

## `elements`

All layouts need to declare an `elements` property which contains the children which are to be arranged by the layout.
It is expected to be an array of UI Schema elements, e.g. controls or other layouts.

## `type`

By default, JSON Forms supports four different kinds of layouts: `VerticalLayout` and `HorizontalLayout`, a slightly modified version of the vertical layout called `Group` as well `Categorization`, which is often used to bundle related data, for instance by means of Tabs.
Those four core layouts are detailed in the following.

## HorizontalLayout

<ApiLink link='core/interfaces/horizontallayout.html' title='API' />

Horizontal layouts use the `HorizontalLayout` type and arranges its contained `elements` in a horizontal fashion.
Each child occupies the same amount of space, i.e. for n children a child occupies 1/n space.

```json
{
  "type": "HorizontalLayout",
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "Control",
      "label": "Name",
      "scope": "#/properties/name"
    },
    {
      "type": "Control",
      "label": "Birth Date",
      "scope": "#/properties/birthDate"
    }
  ]
}
```

<DemoButton to='/examples/layouts#horizontal-layout' label='Demo' />

## VerticalLayout

<ApiLink link='core/interfaces/verticallayout.html' title='API' />

Vertical Layouts use the `VerticalLayout` type and arranges its `elements` in a vertical fashion, i.e. all elements are placed beneath each other.

```json
{
  "type": "VerticalLayout",
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "Control",
      "label": "Name",
      "scope": "#/properties/name"
    },
    {
      "type": "Control",
      "label": "Birth Date",
      "scope": "#/properties/birthDate"
    }
  ]
}
```

<DemoButton to='/examples/layouts#vertical-layout' label='Demo' />

## Group

<ApiLink link='core/interfaces/grouplayout.html'>API</ApiLink>

Groups are very similar to `VerticalLayout`s but feature an additional mandatory `label` property
that is used to describe the `elements`.

### `label`

The label property defines an additional string that is used to describe the elements of the Group.

```json
{
  "type": "Group",
  "label": "My Group",
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "Control",
      "label": "Name",
      "scope": "#/properties/name"
    },
    {
      "type": "Control",
      "label": "Birth Date",
      "scope": "#/properties/birthDate"
    }
  ]
}
```

<DemoButton to='/examples/layouts#group' label='Demo' />

## Categorization

<ApiLink link='core/interfaces/categorization.html'>API</ApiLink>

Categorization uses the `Categorization` type and can only contain `elements` of type `Category`. A `Category` itself acts as a container and has an `elements` of its own as well as a `label` that describes the contained data.
Categorizations are typically used to structure controls with related data, e.g. 'Personal Data' and 'Dietary requirements' as demonstrated in example below.

```json
{
  "type": "Categorization",
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "Category",
      "label": "Personal Data",
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "Control",
          "scope": "#/properties/firstName"
        },
        {
          "type": "Control",
          "scope": "#/properties/lastName"
        },
        {
          "type": "Control",
          "scope": "#/properties/age"
        },
        {
          "type": "Control",
          "scope": "#/properties/height"
        },
        {
          "type": "Control",
          "scope": "#/properties/dateOfBirth"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "Category",
      "label": "Dietary requirements",
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "Control",
          "scope": "#/properties/diet"
        },
        {
          "type": "Control",
          "scope": "allergicToPeanuts"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In the example above note how each child within the elements is of type Category.
