:::info ATTENTION

As of JSON Forms 2.5 the React-Redux variant is deprecated in favor of the <a href="/docs/integrations/react">JSON Forms "standalone" component</a>.
See our <a href="https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/MIGRATION.md">migration guide</a> for more information.

:::

JSON Forms makes use of the reducer pattern to maintain its internal state.
This section describes the sub-state managed by JSON Forms.

JSON Forms exports its reducer via the `jsonformsReducer` function.
It's expected that you add this reducer to your application via `combineReducers` under the `jsonforms` key.
The basic structure of the JSON Forms state looks like this:

```javascript
export interface JsonFormsState {
  jsonforms: {
    core: {
      data: any,
      schema: JsonSchema,
      uischema: UISchemaElement,
      errors?: ErrorObject[],
      validator?: ValidateFunction,
      ajv?: Ajv,
      refParserOptions?: RefParser.Options,
    },
    config?: any,
    renderers?: JsonFormsRendererRegistryEntry[],
    cells?: JsonFormsCellRendererRegistryEntry[],
    // allow additional state for JSON Forms
    [additionalState: string]: any,
  };
}
```

Let's inspect each of these state properties:

## `core`

The core substate stores the `data`, which represents the data to be rendered,
the `schema` which describes the structure of the `data` and the `uischema`, which describes how to render the `data`.

The `errors` property stores the current errors.
Under the hood, JSON Forms uses ajv to validate the data against the schema,
hence the `ValidateFunction` and `ErrorObject` types are from ajv.

In `refParserOptions` contains the configuration for the resolver library.

## `config`

The default "options" object for all UI schema elements.

## `renderers`

The renderers property stores all available renderers that are used by JSON Forms when rendering.
If you want to know more about renderers, see the section on [Custom Renderers](/docs/tutorial/custom-renderers).

## `cells`

Cells are like renderers but only represent the data to be displayed and nothing else.
This is not necessarily the case with Renderers stored within renderers, as such renderers may also display a label or any validation errors.
Fields are more universal in the sense that they should not make any assumptions about the environment they are embedded in, e.g. a field may
either be used by a regular control or by a table, where it is used within a call.

In React/Material cells are only used for the table control.
In React/Vanilla cells are used by the table and by the regular renderers.

If you contribute custom renderers/cells, some of them might need to some additional state not covered by JSON Forms.
For that purpose the `additionalState` allows any additional state to be passed in via an index property.
