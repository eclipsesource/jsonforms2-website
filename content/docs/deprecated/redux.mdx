:::info ATTENTION

As of JSON Forms 2.5 the React-Redux variant is deprecated in favor of the <a href="/docs/integrations/react">JSON Forms "standalone" component</a>.
See our <a href="https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/MIGRATION.md">migration guide</a> for more information.

:::

When using Redux, you need to wrap the entry point with a new component called `JsonFormsReduxContext`. The component used for dispatching is now called `JsonFormsDispatch`.
The typical usage in this case is as follows:

```javascript
<Provider store={store}>
  <JsonFormsReduxContext>
    <JsonFormsDispatch />
  </JsonFormsReduxContext>
</Provider>
```
