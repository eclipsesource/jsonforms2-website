:::caution ATTENTION

With version 3.0 of JSON Forms, we no longer include `json-schema-ref-parser` within the core package.
For a migration guide, have a look [here](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/MIGRATION.md).


The following information is legacy documentation only relevant for the React renderers in JSON Forms < 3.0

:::

Sometimes it might not be possible to have just a single schema that you can pass to JSON Forms or it might make sense to split up a very big schema into multiple smaller ones for maintenance reasons.

If that's the case, you can add a custom ref resolver based on [JSON Schema \$Ref parser](https://github.com/APIDevTools/json-schema-ref-parser) that determines how `$ref`s will be resolved. You'll also need to adapt the AJV validator in order to enable validation of the referenced schema.

To do so, use the `refParserOptions` and `ajv` props of the `JsonForms` component and pass in the ref resolver together with the AJV instance.

Here's an example of how to accomplish this. We'll first create a customized AJV instance. `yourSchemaObject` is the actual schema to be referenced while `yourSchemaIdentifier` is the id that can be used to reference the schema via a `$ref`.

```js
const ajv = createAjv();
ajv.addSchema(yourSchemaObject, 'yourSchemaIdentifier');
```

Next, we'll set up the ref resolver. The implementation is up to you, but you'll need to implement a `canRead` method that determines whether a current ref needs to be resolved and a `read` method that returns the actual schema.
The `order` property determines the order in which resolvers are executed, until the first one returns true for `canRead`.
For more info about ref resolving please see the [JSON Schema \$Ref parser documentation](https://apitools.dev/json-schema-ref-parser/docs/plugins/resolvers.html).
Note that the name for the actual resolver, which we called `foo` here, does not actually matter.

```js
const yourSchemaResolver = {
  order: 1,
  canRead: function(file) {
    return file.url.indexOf('yourSchemaIdentifier') !== -1;
  },
  read: function() {
    return JSON.stringify(yourSchemaObject);
  },
};
const refParserOptions = {
  resolve: {
    foo: yourSchemaResolver,
  },
};
```

Finally, you'll need to pass your resolver and ajv instance to JSON Forms:

```js
<JsonForms
  schema={schema}
  uischema={uischema}
  data={data}
  renderers={renderers}
  cells={cells}
  ajv={ajv}
  refParserOptions={refParserOptions}
/>
```

With these changes refs like `$ref: yourSchemaIdentifier#something` will be resolved accordingly.
