# Create a JSON Forms App (Redux)

This section describes how you can integrate JSON Forms into a React app from scratch.
Alternatively you can also clone the [seed app](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed).

1. We'll use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to scaffold a basic React application which we'll use as a starting point.
   If you didn't install `create-react-app` yet, please do so now before continuing.

   Let's now create a basic application with:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-jsonforms-app
   ```

   Scaffolding may take a couple of moments. Once it's finished, switch to your newly created app and
   install all dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd my-jsonforms-app
   npm install
   ```

2. Install JSON Forms and the material renderer set. We'll use an example from JSON Forms in order to obtain
   a JSON schema, a corresponding UI schema and a data instance to be rendered. You don't need to install
   the `@jsonforms/examples` module if you plan to supply your own schema in the following:

   ```bash
   npm install --save @jsonforms/core
   npm install --save @jsonforms/react
   npm install --save @jsonforms/material-renderers
   npm install --save @jsonforms/examples

   npm install --save @material-ui/core
   npm install --save @material-ui/icons
   npm install --save @material-ui/pickers

   # Since 2.2.x, install react, redux and react-redux are peer dependencies
   npm install --save react redux react-redux
   ```

   Since 2.2.x JSON Forms does not include React, redux and react-redux as dependencies, but rather has them
   configured as peer depenencies.

3. Switch to the `src` directory and open `index.js` with an editor of your choice.
   Let's add a couple of imports first:

   ```javascript
   import { combineReducers, createStore } from 'redux';
   import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

   import { Actions, jsonformsReducer } from '@jsonforms/core';
   import { person } from '@jsonforms/examples';
   import {
     materialRenderers,
     materialCells
   } from '@jsonforms/material-renderers';
   import { JsonFormsReduxContext } from '@jsonforms/react';
   ```

   The `person` import is necessary for importing the person example
   while `@jsonforms/material-renderers` imports the
   [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) based
   renderer set. The other ones will be explained in a bit.

   Now let's define the variables that are crucial for JSON Forms to work,
   that is, `data`, `schema` and `uischema`. As previously mentioned, we are
   using the person example from JSON Forms here:

   ```javascript
   const schema = person.schema;
   const uischema = person.uischema;
   const data = person.data;
   ```

   These variables are defined as follows:

   <PersonVars />

4. Still in `index.js`, create a new store with the `createStore` function provided by Redux.
   For that purpose JSON Forms exports its reducer via `jsonformsReducer`. For the initial state we supply
   the renderers we want to use, which we have imported from `@jsonforms/material-renderers`:

   ```javascript
   const store = createStore(
     combineReducers({ jsonforms: jsonformsReducer() }),
     {
       jsonforms: {
         cells: materialCells,
         renderers: materialRenderers
       }
     }
   );
   ```

   In order for JSON Forms to initialize correctly, we also need to dispatch an initialization action that will
   set-up some internal state that's necessary for JSON Forms:

   ```javascript
   store.dispatch(Actions.init(data, schema, uischema));
   ```

5. Wrap the existing `App` component within a `Provider`

   ```javascript
   <Provider store={store}>
     <JsonFormsReduxContext>
       <App />
     </JsonFormsReduxContext>
   </Provider>
   ```

   You can close the <code>index.js</code> file now.

6. Open the `App.js` file and import the `JsonForms` component from `@jsonforms/react`.
   Delete the `header` element and replace it with the `JsonForms` element
   to get a form rendered:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { JsonFormsDispatch } from '@jsonforms/react';
   // other imports...

   class App extends React.Component {
     render() {
       return (
         <div>
           {/* other markup... */}
           <JsonFormsDispatch />
         </div>
       );
     }
   }
   ```
