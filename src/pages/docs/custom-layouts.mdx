# Custom layouts

The default layouts of JSON Forms are a good fit for most scenarios,
but there might be certain situations where you'd want to customize the rendered layouts.
JSON Forms allows for this by registering a custom renderer that produces a different UI
for a given layout.

In this section you will learn how to create and register a custom renderer for a layout.
We will replace the default renderer for groups. By default a group is rendered like this:

<Default />

Our goal is to instead render the UI for groups as depicted below:

<WithCustomRenderer />

## Running the seed

If you want to follow along with this tutorial, you may want to [clone the seed repository](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed)
which basically is just a skeleton application scaffolded by create-react-app with redux
and JSON Forms dependencies added.

```bash
cd jsonforms-react-seed
npm install
npm start
```

Once the dependencies are installed and the local server has been started,
navigate to http://localhost:3000 in order to see the application running.

The seed is described in more detail within the `README.md` file of
the [repo](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed), hence we
only focus on the most crucial parts of the app in the following.

##  Core concepts about rendering

Before explaining how to contribute a component (which will be referred to as "custom layout") to JSON Forms,
we first explain how the basic process of rendering works.

JSON Forms maintains a registry of renderers (which are regular React components in case of the React/Material renderers we use in this tutorial).
When JSON Forms is instructed to render a given UI schema to produce a form, it will start with the root element of the UI Schema and try to
find a renderer for this UI Schema element in its registry of renderers.

To find a matching renderer, JSON Forms relies on so-called testers.
Every renderer has a tester associated with its registration, which is a function of a UI schema and a
JSON schema returning a number.
The returned number is the priority which expresses if and how well a renderer can actually render the
given UI Schema Element (where `NOT_APPLICABLE` aka. `-1` means "not at all").

In order to create and register a renderer, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Change UI Schema to contain a group
2. Create a renderer (a React component)
3. Create a corresponding tester for the renderer
4. Register both the renderer and the tester with the framework

The seed app already contains all of the ingredients necessary to create a custom layout,
which we'll use in the following.

### 1. Add Group to UI Schema

The first step is to extend our UI Schema and add a Group to it. 
You can find the UISchema in `src\uischema.json`. 
We can change the type of the root from `"type": "VerticalLayout",` to `"type": "Group",`. 
As a group can have a label we should add it, too: `"label": "My Group!!",` .
We can keep everything else unchanged.

### 2. Create a renderer

As mentioned previously, the seed app already features a component which we want to use as a renderer.
We first need to create a new component in `src\MyGroup.jsx`.

Here we can code our component. For our example we create a single ExpansionPanel.
In order to render the child elements we reuse the `MaterialLayoutRenderer` which we can import from `@jsonforms/material-renderers`.

In order to leverage the React component to a JSON Forms compatible renderer, we need to connect it to the store.
This will give us all relevant props to render the group and delegate to the layout renderer.
JSON Forms provides a helper function `mapStateToLayoutProps` for us.
In this case, the props are:
 `uischema`, which is the actual uischema element to be rendered
 `path`, which is necessary to propagate an update back to the store
 `schema`, which is the JSON Schema
 `visible`, which tells us whether the renderer is visible based on rule evaluation
 `renderers`, which is the list of all known renderers and needed for further rendering

The complete code of `src/MyGroup.jsx` looks as follows:

```jsx
import { mapStateToLayoutProps } from "@jsonforms/core";
import { MaterialLayoutRenderer } from "@jsonforms/material-renderers";
import {
  ExpansionPanel,
  ExpansionPanelDetails,
  ExpansionPanelSummary,
  Hidden,
  Typography
} from "@material-ui/core";
import ExpandMoreIcon from "@material-ui/icons/ExpandMore";
import React from "react";
import { connect } from "react-redux";

const MyGroupRenderer = props => {
  const { uischema, schema, path, visible, renderers } = props;

  const layoutProps = {
    elements: uischema.elements,
    schema: schema,
    path: path,
    direction: "column",
    visible: visible,
    uischema: uischema,
    renderers: renderers
  };
  return (
    <Hidden xsUp={!visible}>
      <ExpansionPanel>
        <ExpansionPanelSummary expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}>
          <Typography>{uischema.label}</Typography>
        </ExpansionPanelSummary>
        <ExpansionPanelDetails>
          <MaterialLayoutRenderer {...layoutProps} />
        </ExpansionPanelDetails>
      </ExpansionPanel>
    </Hidden>
  );
};

export default connect(mapStateToLayoutProps)(MyGroupRenderer);
```

### 3. Create a tester

Now that we have our renderer ready, we need to tell JSON Forms when we want to make use of it.
For that purpose we create a tester that checks if the corresponding UI schema element is a group.
If that is the case, we return a rank of `1000`.

The `src/MyGroup.jsx` file contains the respective code.

```javascript
import { 
  rankWith, 
  uiTypeIs 
} from '@jsonforms/core';

export const myGroupTester = rankWith(1000, uiTypeIs("Group"));
```

Generally speaking, the testers API if made out of different predicates and functions that allow
for composition (e.g. `and` or `or`) such that it is easy to target specific parts
of the UI schema and/or JSON schema.

### 4. Register the renderer
 All there is left to do is to register the renderer with its tester. We can do so by calling
the `registerRenderer` action on the store. Within `index.js`, the following
statement registers the renderer.

```javascript
import MyGroupRenderer, { myGroupTester } from './MyGroup';

store.dispatch(
  Actions.registerRenderer(
    myGroupTester, 
    MyGroupRenderer
  )
);
```

And that's it! The MyGroup renderer will now be used to render the `Group` element.
