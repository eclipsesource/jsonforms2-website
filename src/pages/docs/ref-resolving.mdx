# Ref Resolving

Sometimes it might not be possible to have just a single schema that you can pass to JSON Forms 
or it might make sense to split up a very big schema into multiple smaller ones for maintenance reasons.

If that's the case, you can add a custom ref resolver based on [JSON Schema $Ref parser](https://github.com/APIDevTools/json-schema-ref-parser) 
that determines how `$ref`s will be resolved. You'll also need to adapt the AJV validator in order to enable validation of the referenced schema.

To do, use the [`init` action](/docs/available-actions#initdata-any-schema-jsonschema-uischema-uischemaelement-options-initactionoptions--ajvajv) of JSON Forms
and pass in the ref resolver together with the AJV instance.

Here's an eample of how to accomplish this. We'll first create a customized AJV instance. `yourSchemaObject` is the actual schema to be referenced
while `yourSchemaIdentifier` is the id that can be used to reference the schema via a `$ref`.

```javascript
const ajv = createAjv();
ajv.addSchema(
  yourSchemaObject,
  'yourSchemaIdentifier'
);
```

Next, we'll set up the ref resolver. The implementation is up to you, but you'll need to implement a `canRead` method that 
determines whether a current ref needs to be resolved and a `read` method that returns the actual schema. The `order` property
determines the order in which resolvers are executed, until the first one returns true for `canRead`. For more info about ref resolving 
please see the [JSON Schema $Ref parser documentation](https://apidevtools.org/json-schema-ref-parser/docs/plugins/resolvers.html).

```javascript
const yourSchemaResolver = {
  order: 1,
  canRead: function(file) {
    return file.url.indexOf('yourSchemaIdentifier') !== -1;
  },
  read: function() {
    return JSON.stringify(yourSchemaObject)
  }
}
```

Finally, you'll need to initialize JSON Forms:

```javascript
store.dispatch(
  Actions.init(
      data,
      schema,
      uischema,
      {
          ajv,
          resolve: {
              foo: yourSchemaResolver
          }
      }
  )
)
```

Note that the name for the actual resolver, which we called `foo` here, does not actually matter. 

With these changes refs like `$ref: yourSchemaIdentifier#something` will be resolved accordingly.
