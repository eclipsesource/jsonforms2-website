# Ref Resolving

Sometimes it might not be possible to have just a single schema that you can pass to JSON Forms
or it might make sense to split up a very big schema into multiple smaller ones for maintenance reasons.

If that's the case, you can add a custom ref resolver based on [JSON Schema \$Ref parser](https://github.com/APIDevTools/json-schema-ref-parser)
that determines how `$ref`s will be resolved. You'll also need to adapt the AJV validator in order to enable validation of the referenced schema.

To do, use the `refParserOptions` and `ajv` props of the `JsonForms` component and pass in the ref resolver together with the AJV instance.

Here's an eample of how to accomplish this. We'll first create a customized AJV instance. `yourSchemaObject` is the actual schema to be referenced
while `yourSchemaIdentifier` is the id that can be used to reference the schema via a `$ref`.

```javascript
const ajv = createAjv();
ajv.addSchema(yourSchemaObject, 'yourSchemaIdentifier');
```

Next, we'll set up the ref resolver. The implementation is up to you, but you'll need to implement a `canRead` method that
determines whether a current ref needs to be resolved and a `read` method that returns the actual schema. The `order` property
determines the order in which resolvers are executed, until the first one returns true for `canRead`. For more info about ref resolving
please see the [JSON Schema \$Ref parser documentation](https://apidevtools.org/json-schema-ref-parser/docs/plugins/resolvers.html).
Note that the name for the actual resolver, which we called `foo` here, does not actually matter.

```javascript
const yourSchemaResolver = {
  order: 1,
  canRead: function(file) {
    return file.url.indexOf('yourSchemaIdentifier') !== -1;
  },
  read: function() {
    return JSON.stringify(yourSchemaObject);
  },
};
const refParserOptions = {
  resolve: {
    foo: yourSchemaResolver,
  },
};
```

Finally, you'll need to pass your resolver and ajv instance to JSON Forms:

```javascript
<JsonForms
  schema={schema}
  uischema={uischema}
  data={data}
  renderers={renderers}
  cells={cells}
  ajv={ajv}
  refParserOptions={refParserOptions}
/>
```

With these changes refs like `$ref: yourSchemaIdentifier#something` will be resolved accordingly.
