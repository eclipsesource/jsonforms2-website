# Available Actions

JSON Forms provides a couple of action to interact with the store, which we describe here. All actions might either be imported directly or via the Actions utility.

## `init(data: any, schema: JsonSchema, uischema: UISchemaElement, options: InitActionOptions | AJV.Ajv)` 

<ApiLink link='/public/api/core/interfaces/initaction.html' title='API' /> 

The INIT action expects the data, schema and uischema and initializes the store accordingly. Currently, this action must be called in order for JSON Forms to work properly.

The `options` parameter allows customization of the validator and the ref resolver that are both used by JSONForms.
Please see the respective section on [Validation](/docs/validation) and [ref resolving](/docs/ref-resolving) for more details.

## `update(path: string, updater: (existingData: any) => any` 

<ApiLink link='/public/api/core/interfaces/updateaction.html' title='API' /> 

The update is action is used to update the data substate within the store. It expects two arguments: a dot-separated path describing which part of the data should be updated as well as a function that returns the value that should be used. The function gets passed the current value that might be used to calculate the updated value.  mapDispatchToControlProps and  mapDispatchToFieldProps  provide a helper function called handleChange which already dispatches the update action, so that you rarely need to interact with update itself, if at all.

## `registerRenderer(tester: RankedTester, renderer: any)` 

<ApiLink link='/public/api/core/interfaces/addrendereraction.html' title='API' /> 

This actions allow to register a renderer, respectively. It expects two arguments, the 1st being a tester and the 2nd the actual renderer. 
Please see the section about [Custom Renderers](/docs/custom-renderers) for an example how to use these.

## `registerUISchema(tester: UISchemaTester, uischema: UISchemaElement)`

<ApiLink link='/public/api/core/interfaces/adduischemaaction.html' title='API' /> 

When initializing JSON Forms you have to provide a UISchema. 
In many cases this is already enough as it covers most use cases. 
But in some cases, especially when rendering (nested) arrays, 
you have to provide a UISchema which can be retrieved. This allows 

The registration of an UISchema looks as follows:

```javascript
import { Actions, NOT_APPLICABLE } from '@jsonforms/core';

store.dispatch(Actions.registerUISchema(
  (jsonSchema, schemaPath) => {
    return schemaPath === '#/properties/firstarray' ? 2 : NOT_APPLICABLE;
  },
  {
    type: 'VerticalLayout',
    elements: [
      {
        type: 'Control',
        scope: '#/properties/firstName'
      },
      {
        type: 'Control',
        scope: '#/properties/lastName'
      }
    ]
  }
));
```

You can retrieve a registered UI schema via the `findUISchema` function.

## `unregisterUISchema(tester: UISchemaTester)`

<ApiLink link='/public/api/core/globals.html#unregisteruischema' title='API' /> 

This actions allow to unregister a previously registered UI schema
