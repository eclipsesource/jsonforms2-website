# UI Schema Elements

The UI schema, which is passed to JSON Forms,
describes the general layout of a form and is just a regular JSON object.
It describes the form by means of different UI schema elements, which can often be
categorized into either Controls or Layouts.

Some UI schema elements allow an `options` property which allows for further configuration
of the rendering result. The actual configuration options are often renderer specific and
hence need to be looked up.

## Available elements

- [Controls](/docs/uischema/controls)
