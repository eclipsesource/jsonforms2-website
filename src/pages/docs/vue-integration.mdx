# Vue Integration

<Note

With version 2.5 of jsonforms we add support for Vue 2 and Vue 3. While Vue 3 will be supported in the future, support for Vue 2 will be phased out once the community moves on.
The Vue based renderer-set will be released soon!

At this point in time, the only documentation available is the README.md file within the [Vue 2 package](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/vue2/README.md) and within the [Vue 3 package](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/vue/README.md).
