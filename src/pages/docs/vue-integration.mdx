With version 2.5 of JSON Forms we added support for Vue 2 (`@jsonforms/vue2`) and Vue 3 (`@jsonforms/vue`). Support for Vue 2 will be phased out once the community moves on.

For Vue we provide a HTML5 based renderer set, `@jsonforms/vue2-vanilla` for Vue 2 and `@jsonforms/vue-vanilla` for Vue 3.
Additionaly we offer a [jsonforms-vue-seed](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-vue-seed), which allows to get a quick start with our vue integration. By default the seed is based on Vue3. The Vue2 variant can be found on the `vue2` branch.

For further information on how to use JSON Forms Vue and how to write an own renderer set, please consult the README.md files within the [Vue 2](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/vue2/vue2/README.md) and [Vue 3](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/vue/vue/README.md) packages.
