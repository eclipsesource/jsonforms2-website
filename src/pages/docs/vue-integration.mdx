With version 2.5 of JSON Forms we added support for Vue 2 (`@jsonforms/vue2`) and Vue 3 (`@jsonforms/vue`). Support for Vue 2 will be phased out once the community moves on.

We're currently working on a Vue-based renderer set and plan to release it within Q1/21.

For further information on how to use JSON Forms Vue and how to write an own renderer set, please consult the README.md files within the [Vue 2](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/vue2/README.md) and [Vue 3](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/vue/README.md) packages.
