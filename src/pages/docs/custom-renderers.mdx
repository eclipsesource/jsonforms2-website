# Custom Renderers

The default renderers of JSON Forms are a good fit for most scenarios,
but there might be certain situations where you'd want to customize the rendered UI Schema elements.
JSON Forms allows for this by registering a custom renderer that produces a different UI
for a given UI Schema element.

In this section you will learn how to create and register a custom renderer for a control.
We will replace the default renderer for integer values of a rating property.

<Note

  body='While the high level concepts are the same, there are large implementation differences between the offered React, Angular and Vue renderer sets.
This tutorial describes how to add custom renderers for React-based renderer sets.'
/>

By default an integer property is rendered like this:

<Default />

Our goal is to replace the default renderer with a custom one which will render the UI for rating as depicted below:

<WithCustomRenderer />

## Running the seed

If you want to follow along with this tutorial, you may want to [clone the seed repository](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed)
which basically is just a skeleton application scaffolded by create-react-app and JSON Forms dependencies added.
It showcases how to use the standalone JSON Forms component and the legacy version with a Redux store (deprecated).

```bash
cd jsonforms-react-seed
npm install
npm start
```

Once the dependencies are installed and the local server has been started,
navigate to http://localhost:3000 in order to see the application running.

The seed is described in more detail within the `README.md` file of
the [repo](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed), hence we
only focus on the most crucial parts of the app in the following.

## Core concepts about rendering

Before explaining how to contribute a component (which we will refer to as a "custom control") to JSON Forms,
we first explain how the basic process of rendering works.

JSON Forms maintains a registry of renderers (which are regular React components in case of the React/Material renderers we use in this tutorial).
When JSON Forms is instructed to render a given UI schema to produce a form, it will start with the root element of the UI Schema and try to
find a renderer for this UI Schema element in its registry of renderers.

To find a matching renderer, JSON Forms relies on so-called testers.
Every renderer has a tester associated with its registration, which is a function of a UI schema and a
JSON schema returning a number.
The returned number is the priority which expresses if and how well a renderer can actually render the
given UI Schema Element (where `NOT_APPLICABLE` aka. `-1` means "not at all").

In order to create and register a renderer, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Create a renderer (a React component)
2. Create a corresponding tester for the renderer
3. Register both the renderer and the tester with the framework

The seed app already contains all of the ingredients necessary to create a custom renderer,
which we'll use in the following.

### 1. Create a renderer

As mentioned previously, the seed app already features a component which we want to use as a renderer.
It's contained in `src/Rating.tsx` and is a rating control, i.e. it allows to set a value between 0 and 5
by selecting the appropriate number of stars. We won't go into detail about the control itself, but we should mention
that we need to provide an `onClick` property in order to allow specifying a callback which gets called
every time the user clicks on a star. We also need to suppy an initial `value`.

In order to use our React component as a JSON Forms compatible renderer, we can use the `withJsonFormsControlProps` utility function
from JSON Forms that will give us all necessary props to render the control.
This will allow us to retrieve the initial value and to emit events updating the respective value when the users clicks on a star.
In this case, the props are `data`, which is the actual data bit to be rendered, `path`,
a dot-separated string, which represents the path the data is written to and the `handleChange` handler function which we can use for the `onClick` prop of our `Rating` control.
All the handler actually does is to emit a change with the new value.

The complete code of `src/RatingControl.tsx` looks as follows:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { withJsonFormsControlProps } from '@jsonforms/react';
import { Rating } from './Rating';

interface RatingControlProps {
  data: any;
  handleChange(path: string, value: any): void;
  path: string;
}

const RatingControl = ({ data, handleChange, path }: RatingControlProps) => (
  <Rating
    value={data}
    onClick={(ev: any) => handleChange(path, Number(ev.value))}
  />
);

export default withJsonFormsControlProps(RatingControl);
```

### 2. Create a tester

Now that we have our renderer ready, we need to tell JSON Forms when we want to make use of it.
For that purpose we create a tester that checks if the corresponding UI schema element is a control
and whether it is bound to a path that ends with `rating`. If that is the case, we return a rank of `3`.
That is because the default renderer sets provide a rank with a value of `2`, hence our tester will need to
rank the custom control higher, such that it will be picked up for the rating control during rendering.
The `ratingControlTester.js` file contains the respective code as a default export.

```javascript
import { rankWith, scopeEndsWith } from '@jsonforms/core';

export default rankWith(
  3, //increase rank as needed
  scopeEndsWith('rating')
);
```

Generally speaking, the testers API is made out of different predicates and functions that allow
for composition (e.g. `and` or `or`) such that it is easy to target specific parts
of the UI schema and/or JSON schema.

### 3. Register the renderer

All that's left to do is to use the renderer with its tester. We can do so by appending
the renderer/tester pair to the array of renderer registrations used by the `JsonForms` component.
Within `App.tsx`, find the list of renderers used by the standalone `JsonForms` component and add the renderer and its tester like so:

```javascript
import RatingControl from './RatingControl';
import ratingControlTester from './ratingControlTester';

// list of renderers declared outside the App component
const renderers = [
  ...materialRenderers,
  //register custom renderers
  { tester: ratingControlTester, renderer: RatingControl },
];
```

Then, by simply passing the list of renderers to JSON Forms, our custom rating renderer will now be used to render the `rating` property.

```javascript
<JsonForms
  // other necessary declarations go here...
  renderers={renderers}
/>
```

And that's it!
It should be noted that in order to create a full-fledged control there's more work left to do,
since we did not cover concepts like validation or visibility.

## Dispatching

When writing custom renderers that themselves dispatch to JSON Forms, there are two components that can be used: `ResolvedJsonFormsDispatch` and `JsonFormsDispatch`.
For performance reasons, it is almost always preferable to use the `ResolvedJsonFormsDispatch` component.
In contrast to `ResolvedJsonFormsDispatch`, the `JsonFormsDispatch` component will additionally check and resolve external schema refs, which is almost never needed in a nested component such as a renderer.

## Extending existing controls
There are also scenarios where you just want to modify the HTML output of an existing control, e.g. to display an additional value defined in your schema.
Let's say you want to add a checkbox to a form that reflects whether or not the customer want's expedited shipping, and you want to display the added price on the same level as the description is normally rendered. But you do not want the checkbox to behave any different than the stock JSON Forms checkbox.

For this purpose, JSON Forms exposes its renderers in an unwrapped state. 
The following steps are also based on the [seed repository](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed).

### 1. Add the Control to uischema.json
```JSON
	{ "type": "Control",
	  "description": "Expedited Shipping",
	  "scope": "#/properties/expedited_shipping"
	}
```
### 2. Add the field to schema.json
```JSON
	"expedited_shipping":{
		"type": "boolean",
		"price": 20
	}
```

### 3. Create a renderer and tester
The exported controls from '@jsonforms/material-renderers' are wrapped as a [Higher-Order Component (HOC)](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) with their respective props for state/onchange and other functionality.
If we were to use those wrapped controls, we would have to handle these props in our extended control as well, otherwise we would lose functionality of the control.
A better way is to use the control in an unwrapped state, and then reuse the function used for wrapping by the respective control. This ensures the correct properties are passed to the original control.

The unwrapped controls are all exported in an object called Unwrapped in ['@jsonforms/material-renderers'](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/blob/master/packages/material/src/controls/index.ts).
We can import that object, and then use [destructuring](https://medium.com/@lcriswell/destructuring-props-in-react-b1c295005ce0) to access a specific Control.
```javascript
import { Unwrapped } from '@jsonforms/material-renderers';
const { MaterialBooleanControl } = Unwrapped;
```

To determine which HOC to use, we can look at the [source](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms/tree/master/packages/material/src/controls) for the respective control.
Most controls use withJsonFormsControlProps, with exceptions.
Having determined that, we can export our extended control with the same props, so that it maintains compatibility.
```javascript
export default withJsonFormsControlProps(checkBoxWithPriceControl);
```

Since our example also uses a field that is not defined for the type JsonSchema, the property is passed into our control, but cannot be accessed. 
(TypeScript will complain that Property 'price' does not exist on type 'JsonSchema'.)
This can be solved by extending the type with an additional property, and then casting the schema that was passed into the control into that extended type.
```javascript
type JsonSchemaWithPrice = JsonSchema & {price: string}; 
const schema = props.schema as JsonSchemaWithPrice;
```

Finally, we can return the original control, with added HTML elements around it. We use the [Controlprops](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html), imported from core, to make sure our props
have the correct data types.
```javascript
import { ControlProps } from '@jsonforms/core';
...
 export const checkBoxWithPriceControl = (props: ControlProps) => {
 ...
	return (
	<Grid container>
			<Grid item sm={4}>
				<MaterialBooleanControl { ...props}/>
			</Grid>
			{ hasPrice &&
				<Grid item sm={4}> 
					<div>{schema.price}</div>
				</Grid>
			}
		</Grid>
	);
}
```

The complete code of `src/CheckBoxWithPriceControl.tsx`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { JsonSchema,
  ControlProps,
  isBooleanControl,
  RankedTester,
  rankWith,
} from '@jsonforms/core';
import { withJsonFormsControlProps } from '@jsonforms/react';
import Grid from '@material-ui/core/Grid';
import { Unwrapped } from '@jsonforms/material-renderers';
const { MaterialBooleanControl } = Unwrapped;
export const checkBoxWithPriceControl = (props: ControlProps) => {
	// extend the schema to support price property
	type JsonSchemaWithPrice = JsonSchema & {price: string}; 
	const schema = props.schema as JsonSchemaWithPrice;
	const hasPrice = schema.price !== undefined;  
	
	return (
	<Grid container>
			<Grid item sm={4}>
				<MaterialBooleanControl { ...props}/>
			</Grid>
			{ hasPrice &&
				<Grid item sm={4}> 
					<div>{schema.price}</div>
				</Grid>
			}
		</Grid>
	);
};

export const checkBoxWithPriceControlTester: RankedTester = rankWith(
  3,
  isBooleanControl
);
export default withJsonFormsControlProps(checkBoxWithPriceControl);
```

### 4. Register the renderer and tester in App.tsx
Finally, as in the examples above, we need to register our renderers and testers:2
```javascript
import CheckBoxWithPriceControl, { checkBoxWithPriceControlTester } from './CheckBoxWithPriceControl';
...
const renderers = [
  ...materialRenderers,
  //register custom renderers
  { tester: ratingControlTester, renderer: RatingControl
  }, {
	  tester: checkBoxWithPriceControlTester, renderer: CheckBoxWithPriceControl
  }
];
```
