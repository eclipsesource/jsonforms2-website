# Create a JSON Forms App

This section describes how you can integrate JSON Forms into a React app from scratch.
Alternatively you can also clone the [seed app](https://github.com/eclipsesource/jsonforms-react-seed).

1. We'll use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to scaffold a basic React application which we'll use as a starting point.
   If you didn't install `create-react-app` yet, please do so now before continuing.

   Let's now create a basic application with:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-jsonforms-app
   ```

   Scaffolding may take a couple of moments. Once it's finished, switch to your newly created app and
   install all dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd my-jsonforms-app
   npm install
   ```

2. Install JSON Forms and the material renderer set. We'll use an example from JSON Forms in order to obtain
   a JSON schema, a corresponding UI schema and a data instance to be rendered. You don't need to install
   the `@jsonforms/examples` package if you plan to supply your own schema in the following:

   ```bash
   npm install --save @jsonforms/core
   npm install --save @jsonforms/react
   npm install --save @jsonforms/material-renderers
   npm install --save @jsonforms/examples

   npm install --save @material-ui/core
   npm install --save @material-ui/icons
   npm install --save @material-ui/pickers

   # Since version 2.2.x, react, redux and react-redux are peer dependencies
   npm install --save react redux react-redux
   ```

3. Switch to the `src` directory and open `App.js` with an editor of your choice.
   Let's add a couple of imports first:

   ```javascript
   import { person } from '@jsonforms/examples';
   import {
     materialRenderers,
     materialCells
   } from '@jsonforms/material-renderers';
   ```

   The `person` import is necessary for importing the person example
   while `@jsonforms/material-renderers` imports the
   [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) based
   renderer set and respective cells.

   Now let's define the variables that are crucial for JSON Forms to work,
   that is, `data`, `schema` and `uischema`. As previously mentioned, we are
   using the person example from JSON Forms here:

   ```javascript
   const schema = person.schema;
   const uischema = person.uischema;
   const data = person.data;
   ```

   These variables are defined as follows:

   <PersonVars />

4. Now import the `JsonForms` component from `@jsonforms/react`.
   Delete the `header` element and replace it with the `JsonForms` element
   to get a form rendered:

   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { JsonForms } from '@jsonforms/react';
   // other imports...

   function App() {
     return (
       <div className='App'>
         <JsonForms
           schema={schema}
           uischema={uischema}
           data={data}
           renderers={materialRenderers}
           cells={materialCells}
         />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
