# Controls

Controls represent the basic building blocks for creating forms.

A control is usually displaying the value of one property from the data in an UI element such as an input field.
How a control is rendered depends on the type of the property as defined in the JSON Schema,
e.g. a property of type `boolean` is rendered as a Checkbox by default.

## `scope (string)`

The mandatory `scope` property, which expects a [JSON schema reference value](https://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/structuring.html#reuse"),
defines to which property of the data the control should be bound to.

For instance, let's suppose we want to create a control for the `name` property in this schema:

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

The corresponding UI Schema needs to set the type of the UI Schema Element to Control and set the scope to point to the name property from the JSON schema as follows:

```json
{
  "type": "Control",
  "scope": "#/properties/name"
}
```

JSON Forms will render the following form from this UI Schema:

<Example />

JSON Forms ships with a default renderer set which consists of renderers for all primitive types as well as
for arrays. Furthermore JSON Forms allows controls to be replaced or new controls to be added for newly
invented UI Schema Elements. For documentation on these so called **Custom Renderers** please see the section
about [Custom Renderers](/docs/custom-renderers).

## `label (string | boolean)`

By default, controls use the name of property they point to as a label. You can customize this behaviour by specifying a `label` property:

```json
{
  "type": "Control",
  "scope": "#/properties/name",
  "label": "First name"
}
```

Here's the rendered form:

<ExampleWithCustomLabel />

You can also completly disable the label by setting it to `false`.

# Options

## `options` for array controls

Controls referring to arrays can now have an optional `options` 
attribute specifying how the array shall be rendered. 

### `detail`

**`DEFAULT`**
```
options: {
  detail : 'DEFAULT'
}
```
The array will be rendered as before. The string is case insensitive.

**Inline UI schema**
```
options: {
  detail : {
    type: 'HorizontalLayout',
    ...
  }
}
```
The array will be rendered using the nested array renderer. 
The nested renderer will use the specified uischema to render the array elements.

**`GENERATED`**
```
options: {
  detail : 'GENERATED'
}
```
The array will be rendered using the nested array renderer. The nested renderer will use a generated uischema to render the array elements. The string is case insensitive.

**`REGISTERED`**
```
options: {
  detail : 'REGISTERED'
}
```
The array will be rendered using the nested array renderer. 
The nested renderer will check if a uischema was registered for the type to be rendered or generate one itself. 
This case will be triggered if detail is any string besides `GENERATED` (case insensitiv) or `DEFAULT` (case insensitive).

### Sorting buttons

**`showSortButtons`**
```
options: {
  showSortButtons: true
}
```

This options is used to toggle additional buttons that allows changing the order of elements within an array.

<ExampleWithSortButtons />

### Label for array elements

**`elementLabelProp`**
```
options: {
  elementLabelProp: "propertyName"
}
```

This option allows to set a property to serve as a label for each array item. The `elementLabelProp` can be provided as a string or an array. More information can be found here:
https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#get

By default the first primitive (string, number, integer) element will be used.

In the following example each element will be labeled with its name instead of its message because we provide the name prop.

<ExampleWithArrayLabel />

### Radio groups

**`format: 'radio'`**
```
options: {
  format: 'radio'
}
```

Use the `format: 'radio'` option to display an enum as a radio group.

<ExampleWithRadioGroup />


## Theming
### Customize 'clear input button' background

```
<ThemeProvider
  theme={{
    jsonforms: { input: { delete: { background: '#f44336' }}}
  }}
>
  <JsonForms
    ...
  />
</ThemeProvider>
```

The background of the the 'clear input button' (the one you can see when you hover of the input field) is by default your theme's `palette.background.default` color. If you want to customize the background of this button you can use the custom theme variable `jsonforms.input.delete.background`.

<ExampleWithCustomClearBackground />
