# Validation

Whenever you change data in the forms generated by JSON Forms, it will be validated in the background in order to display
any messages that violate the JSON schema.

Validation is handled by [AJV](https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv) and can be customized by passing a custom AJV instance as a prop to the `JsonForms` standalone component.

If you do not customize the validator, a default instance will be created for you. That default instance is configured as follows:

```javascript
const ajv = new AJV({
  schemaId: 'auto',
  allErrors: true,
  jsonPointers: true,
  errorDataPath: 'property',
  verbose: true,
  ...options,
});
ajv.addFormat('time', '^([0-1][0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]$');
ajv.addMetaSchema(Draft4);
```

You can either create your own instance or you can use the `createAjv` function provided by JSON Forms that allows overriding the default options
by passing in additional options.

For customizing or localizing AJV error messages we recommend [ajv-errors](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-errors).
